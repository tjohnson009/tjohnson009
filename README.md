Hey there! 

My name is Tim, I'm currently working on the The Odin Project curriculum. I'm learning HTML, CSS and JS. One day I plan to learn Python and SQL. Also want to get some NodeJS under my belt as well. I'm an aspiring well-rounded Web Developer looking for the next best step I can take to grow and continue in this process.
