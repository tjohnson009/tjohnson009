Hey there! 

My name is Tim, Fun fact: I used to live overseas and had a Coding For Dummies book on my desk for years and hardly opened it. Now I use HTML, CSS and JS to create applications. I dabble in PostgreSQL and React, but plan to master React! Aspiring Software Developer looking for the next best step I can take to grow and continue improving what I can create.
